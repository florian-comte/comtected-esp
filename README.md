The goal of this project is to enable remote control over two main functionalities: the swimming pool cover and the outdoor lighting.

The code used to program the Esp8266 micro-controllers, which act as controllable relays, can be found in this repository. Each Esp8266 opens a web server, allowing for control via HTTP requests.

If you are interested on the web application to control all these micro controllers, feel free to contact me (still in development).
